# Day 6: Trash Compactor (2025)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a "math worksheet" where problems are arranged horizontally. Each problem consists of a column of numbers and an operator (`+` or `*`) at the bottom. We need to solve each problem and sum the results.

### Approach

1.  **Chunking**: Split the grid into "chunks" separated by full columns of spaces.
2.  **Multi-Operator Handling**: A chunk may contain multiple operators.
3.  **Splitting**: Numbers are split at columns containing operators. This ensures that a number spanning across an operator's column is treated as two separate numbers (or assigned specifically).
4.  **Assignment**:
    - Identify all operators in the chunk.
    - Identify all numbers (horizontal for Part 1).
    - Assign each number to the *closest* operator (based on horizontal distance between the number's start and the operator's column).
    - Tie-breaking: If a number is equidistant or overlaps, the "Split All" strategy effectively assigns segments to the nearest operator.
5.  **Solve**: For each operator, perform the operation on its assigned numbers.
6.  **Grand Total**: Sum the results.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **5784380717354**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

The "math worksheet" should be read differently. Each number is a vertical column of digits. The grouping of digits into problems (associated with an operator) remains the same.

### Approach

1.  **Reuse Chunking/Assignment**: Use the same logic as Part 1 to group numbers and assign them to operators.
2.  **Vertical Numbers**: In each chunk, for each column, extract all digits top-to-bottom to form a number.
3.  **Calculate**: Apply the operator to the vertical numbers.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **7996218225744**.
