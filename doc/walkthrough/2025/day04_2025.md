# Day 4: Printing Department (2025)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are in the printing department and need to help the Elves break through a wall. To do this, we need to optimize forklift usage by identifying which paper rolls (`@`) are accessible.

A paper roll is **accessible** if there are **fewer than 4** other paper rolls in its 8 adjacent positions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

### Approach

1.  **Parse the Input**: Read the grid of characters.
2.  **Iterate**: Loop through every cell in the grid.
3.  **Check Condition**:
    - If the cell contains a paper roll (`@`):
        - Count its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) that are also paper rolls (`@`).
        - If the neighbor count is less than 4, increment the `accessible_count`.
4.  **Result**: The final `accessible_count` is the answer.

### Solution

The total number of accessible paper rolls for my input was **1393**.


## Part 2

### Problem Description

The Elves want to remove as many paper rolls as possible.
- Once a paper roll is accessible (fewer than 4 neighbors), it can be **removed**.
- Removing a roll might make other rolls accessible.
- We need to repeat this process until no more rolls can be removed.

### Approach

1.  **Iterative Removal**:
    - Start with the initial grid.
    - Loop indefinitely:
        - Identify all paper rolls that currently have fewer than 4 neighbors.
        - If no such rolls exist, stop.
        - Add the count of these rolls to `total_removed`.
        - Mark these rolls as removed (e.g., change `@` to `.`).
2.  **Result**: The final `total_removed` count is the answer.

### Solution

The total number of paper rolls removed for my input was **8643**.
