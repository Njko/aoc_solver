# Day 8: Playground (2025)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a list of 3D coordinates representing junction boxes. We need to connect the closest pairs of boxes to form circuits. Specifically, we connect the **1000 closest pairs**. After making these connections, we need to find the sizes of the connected components (circuits) and multiply the sizes of the three largest ones.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Input**: Read the `x,y,z` coordinates.
2.  **Calculate Distances**: Compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of points. Since N=1000, there are roughly 500,000 pairs, which is manageable.
3.  **Sort Pairs**: Sort all pairs by distance in ascending order.
4.  **Connect**: Iterate through the top 1000 pairs. Use a **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** data structure to merge the sets of connected points.
5.  **Analyze Components**: After processing the pairs, count the size of each component (circuit).
6.  **Result**: Identify the three largest components and multiply their sizes.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **68112**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

The Elves need to connect *all* junction boxes into a single large circuit (Minimum Spanning Tree). We need to find the last connection made (the one that reduces the number of connected components to 1) and multiply the X coordinates of the two junction boxes involved in that connection.

### Approach

1.  **Reuse Logic**: Use the same distance calculation and sorting from Part 1.
2.  **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Iterate through the sorted edges (closest pairs first).
3.  **Connect**: Use Union-Find to merge components.
4.  **Track Components**: Start with N components. Each successful merge reduces the count by 1.
5.  **Identify Last Connection**: The merge that reduces the component count to 1 is the critical connection.
6.  **Result**: Multiply the X coordinates of the two points connected by this last edge.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **44543856**.
