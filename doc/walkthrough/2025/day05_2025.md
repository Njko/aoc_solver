# Day 5: Cafeteria (2025)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a list of "fresh" ingredient ID ranges and a list of available ingredient IDs. We need to count how many of the available IDs fall into at least one of the fresh ranges.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Input**: Separate the input into ranges (e.g., `3-5`) and individual IDs.
2.  **Check Ranges**: For each available ID, iterate through all fresh ranges.
3.  **Count**: If an ID falls within any range (`start <= id <= end`), increment the count.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **525**.


## Part 2

### Problem Description

We need to calculate the total number of ingredient IDs that are considered fresh. This is equivalent to finding the size of the union of all fresh ID ranges.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Ranges**: Extract all the fresh ID ranges.
2.  **Sort**: Sort the ranges by their start value.
3.  **Merge**: Iterate through the sorted ranges and merge overlapping or adjacent ranges.
    - If the current range overlaps with or touches the previous merged range, extend the previous range.
    - Otherwise, start a new merged range.
4.  **Sum Lengths**: Calculate the length of each merged range (`end - start + 1`) and sum them up.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **333892124923577**.
