# Day 3: Spiral Memory (2017)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a number on an infinite spiral grid starting at 1. We need to find the Manhattan distance from this number to the center (1).

### Approach

1.  **Identify Ring**: Find the "ring" level `k` where the target number resides. The bottom-right corner of ring `k` is `(2k+1)^2`.
2.  **Find Centers**: Calculate the values at the center of each side of the ring.
3.  **Calculate Distance**: The distance is `k` (steps to reach the ring from center) plus the distance from the target to the nearest side center along the ring.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **326**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

We need to fill the spiral grid such that each cell is the sum of its adjacent neighbors (including diagonals). We need to find the first value written that is larger than the input.

### Approach

1.  **Simulate Spiral**: Generate coordinates in a spiral pattern (R, U, L, D).
2.  **Store Values**: Use a dictionary to store the value at each coordinate.
3.  **Sum Neighbors**: For each new coordinate, calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors.
4.  **Check Condition**: If the new value is larger than the input, return it.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **363010**.
