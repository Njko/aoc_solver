# Day 2: Corruption Checksum (2017)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a spreadsheet (rows of numbers). For each row, we need to calculate the difference between the largest and smallest value. The checksum is the sum of these differences.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Input**: Read the spreadsheet, splitting by newlines and then by whitespace (tabs or spaces).
2.  **Process Rows**: For each row:
    - Find the maximum value (`max_val`).
    - Find the minimum value (`min_val`).
    - Calculate `diff = max_val - min_val`.
    - Add `diff` to the total sum.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **32121**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

For each row, we need to find the **only two numbers** where one evenly divides the other. We need to divide them and add the result to the sum.

### Approach

1.  **Process Rows**: For each row:
    - Iterate through all pairs of numbers `(a, b)`.
    - Check if `a % b == 0`. If so, add `a // b` to the total sum.
    - Check if `b % a == 0`. If so, add `b // a` to the total sum.
    - Stop searching for the current row once a pair is found (since there's exactly one pair per row).

### Solution

The solution for my input was **197**.
