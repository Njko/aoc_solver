### Problem Overview
Santa needs to update his password. The password must follow specific security rules involving increasing straights, forbidden letters, and pairs. We need to find the next valid password by incrementing the string.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the next valid password after the given input.

**Approach:**
- **Incrementing:** Treat the string like a base-26 number (a-z). Increment the last character. If it wraps from 'z' to 'a', carry over to the previous character.
    - *Optimization:* If an invalid character ('i', 'o', 'l') is found, we could skip ahead, but a simple increment loop is sufficient for this problem size.
- **Validation Rules:**
    1.  **Straight:** Must contain a straight of at least three increasing letters (e.g., 'abc', 'bcd').
    2.  **Forbidden:** Must not contain 'i', 'o', or 'l'.
    3.  **Pairs:** Must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters (e.g., 'aa...bb').
- **Algorithm:** Continuously increment the password string until it satisfies all validation rules.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the next valid password after the one found in Part 1.

**Approach:**
- Take the result from Part 1.
- Continue the increment-and-check loop until the next valid password is found.
