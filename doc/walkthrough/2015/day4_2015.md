# Advent of Code 2015 Solutions

## Day 04: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

### Problem Overview
Santa needs to mine AdventCoins. This involves finding MD5 hashes that start with a specific prefix (zeros), given a secret key.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the lowest positive number `i` such that the MD5 hash of `secret_key + i` starts with `00000`.

**Approach:**
- Start with `i = 0`.
- Loop indefinitely:
  - Construct the string `s = key + str(i)`.
  - Calculate the MD5 hash of `s`.
  - Check if the hexadecimal representation of the hash starts with `00000`.
  - If it does, return `i`.
  - Otherwise, increment `i` and continue.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the lowest positive number `i` such that the MD5 hash starts with `000000` (six zeros).

**Approach:**
- Same as Part 1, but check for the prefix `000000`.
- Note: This takes significantly longer than Part 1 due to the increased difficulty.
