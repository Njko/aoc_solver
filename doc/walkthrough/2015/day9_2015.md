# Advent of Code 2015 Solutions

## Day 09: All in a Single Night

### Problem Overview
Santa needs to visit every location exactly once, starting and ending at distinct locations (Traveling Salesperson Problem). We are given distances between pairs of locations.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the shortest route that visits each location exactly once.

**Approach:**
- **Parsing:** Build a distance map (adjacency matrix or dictionary) where `dist[(A, B)] = distance`. Since the graph is undirected, store both `(A, B)` and `(B, A)`. Identify the set of all unique locations.
- **Algorithm:** Since the number of locations is small (typically < 10 for AoC inputs), we can use a **Brute Force** approach.
    - Generate all possible permutations of the locations using `itertools.permutations`.
    - For each permutation (route), calculate the total distance by summing the distances between consecutive cities.
    - If a pair of cities in the permutation has no defined distance (though the problem implies a complete graph or at least a connected one), that route is invalid.
    - Track the minimum total distance found.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the longest route that visits each location exactly once.

**Approach:**
- Use the same set of permutations as in Part 1.
- Instead of tracking the minimum, track the **maximum** total distance.
