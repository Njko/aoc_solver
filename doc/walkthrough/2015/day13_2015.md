## Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table

### Problem Overview
We need to find the optimal seating arrangement for people around a circular table to maximize total happiness. Each person gains or loses happiness depending on who sits next to them.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the maximum total happiness change for the optimal seating arrangement.

**Approach:**
- **Parsing:** Build a dictionary `happiness[(p1, p2)] = change` representing the happiness `p1` gets from sitting next to `p2`. Identify all unique people.
- **Algorithm:** This is another variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), but with a circular path and edge weights depending on both neighbors.
    - **Permutations:** Generate all permutations of the guests.
    - **Optimization:** Since the table is circular, `[A, B, C]` is the same arrangement as `[B, C, A]`. We can fix one person (e.g., the first one alphabetically) at the first seat to reduce the search space by a factor of `N` (from `N!` to `(N-1)!`).
    - **Scoring:** For each arrangement, sum the happiness for every adjacent pair `(A, B)`. Remember to include both `happiness[(A, B)]` and `happiness[(B, A)]`. Don't forget the wrap-around connection between the last and first person.
    - Track the maximum happiness found.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Add yourself to the table (happiness change 0 with everyone) and find the new maximum happiness.

**Approach:**
- Add "Me" to the list of people.
- Set `happiness[("Me", X)] = 0` and `happiness[(X, "Me")] = 0` for all other people `X`.
- Run the same permutation algorithm as in Part 1 with the updated list of people.
