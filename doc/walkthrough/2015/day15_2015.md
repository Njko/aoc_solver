## Day 15: Science for Hungry People

### Problem Overview
We need to find the best cookie recipe by combining ingredients. Each ingredient has properties (capacity, durability, flavor, texture, calories). The total amount of ingredients must be exactly 100 teaspoons.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Maximize the total score of the cookie. The score is the product of the sums of each property (capacity, durability, flavor, texture). If any sum is negative, it becomes 0.

**Approach:**
- **Parsing:** Extract ingredient properties into a list.
- **Partitions:** We need to find all combinations of numbers that sum to 100. Since the number of ingredients is small (4 in the input), we can generate these partitions.
    - A recursive generator `partitions(n, k)` can yield tuples of `k` numbers that sum to `n`.
- **Scoring:** For each partition (representing amounts of each ingredient):
    - Calculate the total for each property: `sum(amount * property_value)`.
    - Apply the rule: `max(0, total)`.
    - Calculate the final score: `capacity * durability * flavor * texture`.
- Track the maximum score.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Maximize the total score, but only consider recipes with exactly 500 calories.

**Approach:**
- Use the same partitions generator as Part 1.
- **Filter:** Before calculating the score, check the calorie count: `sum(amount * calories)`.
- If calories == 500, calculate the score and update the maximum.
