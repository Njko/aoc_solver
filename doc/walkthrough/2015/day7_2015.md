## Day 07: Some Assembly Required

### Problem Overview
We are given a set of instructions for a circuit kit. Wires are connected to bitwise logic gates. We need to simulate the circuit to find the signal on a specific wire.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the signal provided to wire `a`.

**Approach:**
- **Parsing:** Read instructions into a dictionary mapping each wire to its input rule (e.g., `x AND y -> z` becomes `z: ['x', 'AND', 'y']`).
- **Simulation:** Use a recursive function `solve_wire(wire)` with **memoization** (caching) to evaluate the signal for any given wire.
    - If the wire's value is already known (cached) or is a raw number, return it.
    - Recursively evaluate the dependencies (operands) for the gate driving the wire.
    - Apply the bitwise operation (AND, OR, NOT, LSHIFT, RSHIFT).
    - Store the result in the cache and return it.
- **Bitwise Operations:** Ensure all results are 16-bit integers by applying `& 0xFFFF`.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Take the signal from wire `a` in Part 1, override wire `b` with that signal, and reset the other wires. Then find the new signal on wire `a`.

**Approach:**
- Run the simulation from Part 1 to get the value of `a`.
- Update the connections dictionary: set wire `b` to directly output the value obtained from Part 1.
- Clear the memoization cache.
- Run the simulation again for wire `a`.
