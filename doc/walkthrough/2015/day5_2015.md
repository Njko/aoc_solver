## Day 05: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

### Problem Overview
Santa needs to figure out which strings in his text file are "nice" based on a set of rules.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Count the number of nice strings based on the first set of rules.
Rules:
1. Contains at least 3 vowels (`aeiou`).
2. Contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row (e.g., `xx`).
3. Does not contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`.

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each string.
- Check Rule 1: Count vowels. If < 3, it's naughty.
- Check Rule 2: Iterate through the string and check if `s[i] == s[i+1]`. If none found, it's naughty.
- Check Rule 3: Check if any forbidden substring is present. If so, it's naughty.
- If all checks pass, increment the nice count.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Count the number of nice strings based on the new set of rules.
Rules:
1. Contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping (e.g., `xyxy` or `aabcdefgaa`).
2. Contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them (e.g., `xyx`, `abcdefeghi`, `aaa`).

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each string.
- Check Rule 1:
  - Iterate through the string to find all pairs `s[i:i+2]`.
  - Check if `s.count(pair) >= 2`. Note: Python's `count` method handles non-overlapping occurrences correctly for this rule (e.g., `aaaa`.count(`aa`) is 2).
- Check Rule 2:
  - Iterate through the string and check if `s[i] == s[i+2]`.
- If both checks pass, increment the nice count.
