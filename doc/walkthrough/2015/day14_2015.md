## Day 14: Reindeer Olympics

### Problem Overview
Reindeer are racing. Each reindeer has a fly speed, fly duration, and rest duration. We need to calculate distances traveled after a certain time.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the distance traveled by the winning reindeer after 2503 seconds.

**Approach:**
- **Mathematical Calculation:** We don't need a second-by-second simulation for this part.
- For each reindeer:
    - Calculate the total cycle time: `cycle_time = fly_time + rest_time`.
    - Determine how many full cycles fit into the total time: `full_cycles = total_time // cycle_time`.
    - Determine remaining seconds: `remaining_time = total_time % cycle_time`.
    - Calculate distance: `(full_cycles * fly_time * speed) + (min(remaining_time, fly_time) * speed)`.
- Return the maximum distance among all reindeer.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Award points to the leading reindeer(s) at the end of each second. Find the highest score after 2503 seconds.

**Approach:**
- **Simulation:** Since points are awarded every second, we must simulate the race second-by-second.
- Maintain the state of each reindeer: `distance`, `points`, `state` (flying/resting), and `time_in_state`.
- Loop from `t = 1` to `2503`:
    - Update each reindeer's distance based on its current state.
    - Update state transitions (flying <-> resting).
    - Find the current maximum distance among all reindeer.
    - Increment the `points` of every reindeer that currently has that maximum distance.
- Return the maximum points.
