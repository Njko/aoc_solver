## Day 06: Probably a Fire Hazard

### Problem Overview
Santa is setting up a 1000x1000 grid of lights. He needs to follow instructions to turn on, turn off, or toggle ranges of lights.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Count how many lights are lit after following the instructions.
Instructions:
- `turn on`: Set light to on (True).
- `turn off`: Set light to off (False).
- `toggle`: Invert the state of the light.

**Approach:**
- Initialize a 1000x1000 grid of booleans (False).
- Parse each instruction using regex to extract the action and the coordinate range `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.
- Iterate through the range `x` from `x1` to `x2` and `y` from `y1` to `y2`.
- Apply the action to `grid[x][y]`.
- Sum the number of True values in the grid.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Calculate the total brightness of the lights.
Instructions (Modified):
- `turn on`: Increase brightness by 1.
- `turn off`: Decrease brightness by 1 (minimum 0).
- `toggle`: Increase brightness by 2.

**Approach:**
- Initialize a 1000x1000 grid of integers (0).
- Parse instructions as in Part 1.
- Iterate through the range and apply the modified actions:
  - `turn on`: `grid[x][y] += 1`
  - `turn off`: `grid[x][y] = max(0, grid[x][y] - 1)`
  - `toggle`: `grid[x][y] += 2`
- Sum all values in the grid.
