## Day 01: Not Quite Lisp

### Problem Overview
Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and follows instructions contained in a string of parentheses.
- `(` means he should go up one floor.
- `)` means he should go down one floor.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Determine the floor Santa ends up on after following all instructions.

**Approach:**
- Initialize a variable `floor` to `0`.
- Iterate through each character in the input string:
  - If the character is `(`, increment `floor` by 1.
  - If the character is `)`, decrement `floor` by 1.
- The final value of `floor` is the answer.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the position of the first character that causes Santa to enter the basement (floor -1).

**Approach:**
- Initialize `floor` to `0`.
- Iterate through the input string, keeping track of the current character's position (1-based index).
- For each character:
  - Update `floor` as in Part 1.
  - Immediately check if `floor` equals `-1`.
  - If it does, return the current position index.
