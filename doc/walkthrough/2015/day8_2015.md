### Problem Overview
Santa's list is a file containing string literals. We need to calculate the difference between the number of characters in the code representation and the number of characters in the in-memory string, and vice-versa for encoded strings.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Calculate `(total code characters) - (total memory characters)`.

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each line of the input file.
- **Code Characters:** Simply the length of the string literal (including surrounding quotes).
- **Memory Characters:** The length of the string after evaluating escape sequences (e.g., `\"` becomes `"`).
    - **Implementation Detail:** Python's `eval()` function can be used to interpret the string literal exactly as the language parser would, which handles all the escape sequences (`\\`, `\"`, `\xHH`) correctly. Alternatively, one could manually parse and replace escape sequences.
- Accumulate the differences.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Calculate `(total encoded characters) - (total code characters)`.

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each line.
- **Encoded Characters:** Re-encode the string literal:
    - Escape backslashes: `\` -> `\\`
    - Escape double quotes: `"` -> `\"`
    - Wrap the entire result in double quotes.
- Calculate the length of this new encoded string.
- Subtract the original code length from the encoded length and accumulate the result.
