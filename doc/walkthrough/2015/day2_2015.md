## Day 02: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

### Problem Overview
The elves need to wrap presents. Each present is a rectangular box with dimensions `l`, `w`, and `h`. They need to calculate the amount of wrapping paper and ribbon required.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Calculate the total square feet of wrapping paper needed.
Formula: `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l` + area of the smallest side.

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each line of the input (each present).
- Parse dimensions `l`, `w`, `h` from the string "lxwxh".
- Calculate the areas of the three sides: `l*w`, `w*h`, `h*l`.
- Calculate surface area: `2 * sum(sides)`.
- Find the smallest side area: `min(sides)`.
- Add surface area and smallest side to the total.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Calculate the total feet of ribbon needed.
Formula: Shortest perimeter of any face + volume of the box.

**Approach:**
- Iterate through each present.
- Sort the dimensions `[l, w, h]` to easily find the two smallest.
- Calculate wrap (shortest perimeter): `2 * (smallest + second_smallest)`.
- Calculate bow (volume): `l * w * h`.
- Add wrap and bow to the total.
