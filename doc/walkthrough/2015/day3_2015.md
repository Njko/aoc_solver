## Day 03: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

### Problem Overview
Santa is delivering presents to houses on an infinite 2D grid. He moves based on instructions `^`, `v`, `>`, `<`.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Count how many houses receive at least one present.

**Approach:**
- Use a set `visited` to store coordinates `(x, y)` of houses that have received a present.
- Start at `(0, 0)` and add it to `visited`.
- Iterate through the moves:
  - Update `x` or `y` based on the direction.
  - Add the new `(x, y)` tuple to `visited`.
- Return the size of the `visited` set.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Santa and Robo-Santa deliver presents together. They take turns moving based on the instructions. Count visited houses.

**Approach:**
- Maintain two positions: `(santa_x, santa_y)` and `(robo_x, robo_y)`.
- Use a single shared `visited` set, initialized with `(0, 0)`.
- Iterate through the moves with an index `i`:
  - If `i` is even, move Santa and update his position.
  - If `i` is odd, move Robo-Santa and update his position.
  - Add the new position (whichever moved) to `visited`.
- Return the size of the `visited` set.
