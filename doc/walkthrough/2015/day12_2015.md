# Advent of Code 2015 Solutions

## Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io

### Problem Overview
We are given a JSON document containing arrays, objects, numbers, and strings. We need to sum all the numbers in the document, with a specific exclusion rule for Part 2.

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Sum all numbers in the JSON document.

**Approach:**
- **Regex:** Since the structure doesn't matter for Part 1, we can treat the input as a raw string.
- Use a regular expression `r"-?\d+"` to find all integers (including negative ones).
- Convert matches to integers and sum them up.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Sum all numbers, but ignore any object (and its children) that contains the value "red".

**Approach:**
- **JSON Parsing:** Parse the input string into a Python object (list/dict structure) using `json.loads()`.
- **Recursive Traversal:** Write a function `sum_ignoring_red(obj)`:
    - If `obj` is an **integer**, return it.
    - If `obj` is a **list**, return the sum of the function applied to its elements.
    - If `obj` is a **dictionary**:
        - Check if "red" is in `obj.values()`. If so, return 0 (ignore the entire object).
        - Otherwise, return the sum of the function applied to its values.
    - If `obj` is a **string** or other type, return 0.
