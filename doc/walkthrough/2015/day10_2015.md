## Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say

### Problem Overview
We need to generate sequences using the "look-and-say" method. Starting with an input string, each subsequent sequence describes the previous one (e.g., "1" becomes "11" (one 1), "11" becomes "21" (two 1s)).

### Part 1 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the length of the result after applying the look-and-say process 40 times.

**Approach:**
- **Transformation:** Use `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive identical characters.
    - For each group, append the count of characters and the character itself to a result list.
    - Join the list to form the new string.
- **Iteration:** Repeat this process 40 times starting with the input string.
- **Result:** Return the length of the final string.

### Part 2 Strategy
**Goal:** Find the length of the result after 50 iterations.

**Approach:**
- Continue the process from Part 1 for another 10 iterations (total 50).
- The string grows exponentially, but 50 iterations are manageable within reasonable time limits using the string construction method.
