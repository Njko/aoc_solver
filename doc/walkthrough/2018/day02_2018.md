# Day 2: Inventory Management System (2018)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We need to calculate a checksum for a list of box IDs. The checksum is the number of IDs containing exactly two of any letter multiplied by the number of IDs containing exactly three of any letter.

### Approach

1.  **Count Frequencies**: For each ID, count the frequency of each letter.
2.  **Check Conditions**: Check if any letter appears exactly twice or exactly three times.
3.  **Accumulate**: Maintain counters for "has exactly two" and "has exactly three".
4.  **Calculate Checksum**: Multiply the two counters.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **6723**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

We need to find two box IDs that differ by exactly one character at the same position. The answer is the string of common characters.

### Approach

1.  **Iterate Pairs**: Check every pair of IDs.
2.  **Compare**: For each pair, count the number of characters that differ at the same position.
3.  **Find Match**: If the difference count is exactly 1, return the common characters.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **prtkqyluiusocwvaezjmhmfgx**.
