# Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It (2018)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a list of claims, each defining a rectangle on a large piece of fabric. We need to find the number of square inches of fabric that are within two or more claims.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Claims**: Extract the ID, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, and height from each claim string (e.g., `#1 @ 1,3: 4x4`).
2.  **Map Grid**: Use a dictionary to represent the grid, where keys are `(x, y)` coordinates and values are the number of claims covering that coordinate.
3.  **Populate Grid**: Iterate through each claim and increment the count for every coordinate it covers.
4.  **Count Overlaps**: Count the number of coordinates in the grid with a value of 2 or greater.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **108961**.

## Part 2

### Problem Description

We need to find the ID of the only claim that does not overlap with any other claim.

### Approach

1.  **Re-use Grid**: Use the populated grid from Part 1.
2.  **Check Claims**: Iterate through each claim again.
3.  **Verify Non-Overlap**: For each claim, check if all its covered coordinates have a count of exactly 1 in the grid.
4.  **Return ID**: If a claim satisfies the condition, return its ID.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **681**.
