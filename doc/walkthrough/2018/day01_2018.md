# Day 1: Chronal Calibration (2018)

## Part 1

### Problem Description

We are given a list of frequency changes (e.g., `+1`, `-2`). Starting from 0, we need to apply these changes and find the resulting frequency.

### Approach

1.  **Parse Input**: Read the list of changes.
2.  **Sum**: Simply sum all the values.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **411**.


## Part 2

### Problem Description

We need to find the first frequency that is reached twice. The list of frequency changes repeats indefinitely.

### Approach

1.  **Initialize**: Keep track of the current frequency (starting at 0) and a set of seen frequencies (containing 0).
2.  **Loop**: Cycle through the changes repeatedly.
3.  **Update**: Apply each change to the current frequency.
4.  **Check**: If the new frequency is already in the set, return it. Otherwise, add it to the set.

### Solution

The solution for my input was **56360**.
