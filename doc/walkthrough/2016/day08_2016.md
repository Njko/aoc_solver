# Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication

## Part 1

The problem asks us to simulate a small screen (50x6 pixels) and count the number of lit pixels after a series of instructions.

The instructions are:
*   `rect AxB`: Turns on all pixels in a rectangle at the top-left of the screen (A wide, B tall).
*   `rotate row y=A by B`: Shifts all pixels in row A right by B positions. Pixels that fall off the right appear on the left.
*   `rotate column x=A by B`: Shifts all pixels in column A down by B positions. Pixels that fall off the bottom appear on the top.

### Strategy

1.  **Grid**: Represent the screen as a 2D list of characters (e.g., '.' for off, '#' for on). Dimensions are 50x6.
2.  **Rect**: For `rect AxB`, iterate `x` from 0 to `A-1` and `y` from 0 to `B-1`, setting `screen[y][x] = '#'`.
3.  **Rotate Row**: Python lists support slicing and concatenation, which makes rotation easy. `new_row = row[-amount:] + row[:-amount]`.
4.  **Rotate Column**: Extract the column into a temporary list, rotate it using the same logic as the row, and then write the values back to the screen.
5.  **Count**: After all instructions, sum the counts of '#' in each row.

### Code Snippet

```python
screen = [['.' for _ in range(50)] for _ in range(6)]

for line in lines:
    if match := re.match(r'rect (\d+)x(\d+)', line):
        w, h = map(int, match.groups())
        for y in range(h):
            for x in range(w):
                screen[y][x] = '#'
    elif match := re.match(r'rotate row y=(\d+) by (\d+)', line):
        row, amount = map(int, match.groups())
        screen[row] = screen[row][-amount:] + screen[row][:-amount]
    elif match := re.match(r'rotate column x=(\d+) by (\d+)', line):
        col, amount = map(int, match.groups())
        column = [screen[y][col] for y in range(6)]
        column = column[-amount:] + column[:-amount]
        for y in range(6):
            screen[y][col] = column[y]

return sum(row.count('#') for row in screen)
```

## Part 2

The second part asks what code is displayed on the screen.

### Strategy

Since we've already simulated the screen state in Part 1, we just need to print it out. The code is formed by the pattern of lit pixels.

### Code Snippet

```python
return "\n" + "\n".join("".join(row) for row in screen)
```
