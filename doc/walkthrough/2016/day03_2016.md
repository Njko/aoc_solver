# Day 3: Squares With Three Sides

## Part 1

The problem asks us to count how many "triangles" are valid. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is larger than the remaining side. The input provides the three side lengths on each line.

### Strategy

The condition "sum of any two sides > third side" is equivalent to "sum of the two smaller sides > largest side". We can sort the three sides `(a, b, c)` such that `a <= b <= c`. Then the condition simplifies to `a + b > c`.

For each line of the input:
1.  Parse the three numbers.
2.  Sort them.
3.  Check if the sum of the first two is greater than the third.
4.  Count the valid triangles.

### Code Snippet

```python
def _is_valid_triangle(sides):
    a, b, c = sorted(sides)
    return a + b > c

count = 0
for line in self.input_data.strip().split('\n'):
    sides = [int(s) for s in line.split()]
    if self._is_valid_triangle(sides):
        count += 1
return count
```

## Part 2

The second part changes how we read the triangles. Instead of reading horizontally (rows), we must read vertically (columns). Each set of three lines forms three triangles: one from the first column, one from the second, and one from the third.

### Strategy

We can read all numbers into a 2D list (list of rows). Then we iterate through the rows in chunks of 3.

For each chunk of 3 rows (rows `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`):
1.  Form a triangle from the first column: `(row[i][0], row[i+1][0], row[i+2][0])`
2.  Form a triangle from the second column: `(row[i][1], row[i+1][1], row[i+2][1])`
3.  Form a triangle from the third column: `(row[i][2], row[i+1][2], row[i+2][2])`
4.  Check the validity of each triangle and update the count.

### Code Snippet

```python
lines = self.input_data.strip().split('\n')
numbers = []
for line in lines:
    numbers.append([int(s) for s in line.split()])

count = 0
for i in range(0, len(numbers), 3):
    for j in range(3):
        triangle = (numbers[i][j], numbers[i+1][j], numbers[i+2][j])
        if self._is_valid_triangle(triangle):
            count += 1
return count
```
