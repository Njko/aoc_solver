# Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators

## Part 1

The solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path to the goal state. The state is defined by the elevator's current floor and the configuration of items on all floors.

A key optimization is to use a canonical representation of the state for the `visited` set. Instead of tracking the exact items, we track the floor of each microchip and its corresponding generator as a pair. This significantly reduces the state space because the names of the elements (e.g., polonium, thulium) are interchangeable.

The `_is_valid` function ensures that no microchip is on a floor with a generator unless its own generator is also present.

The BFS explores all valid moves (moving 1 or 2 items up or down) until it reaches the state where all items are on the fourth floor.

The final answer for Part 1 is **37**.

## Part 2

For Part 2, two new pairs of items (elerium and dilithium) are added to the first floor. The same BFS algorithm is used, but with the expanded initial state.

The canonical state representation proves crucial here, as the state space is much larger. The code dynamically adds the new items to the parsed input and re-runs the solver.

The final answer for Part 2 is **61**.
