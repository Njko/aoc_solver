# Day 6: Signals and Noise

## Part 1

The problem asks us to error-correct a message sent via a repetition code. The message is hidden in a list of strings, where for each position, the correct character is the most frequent character at that position across all strings.

### Strategy

1.  **Transpose**: We need to look at the characters column by column. We can iterate through the columns (0 to length-1).
2.  **Collect**: For each column index `i`, collect the `i`-th character from every line.
3.  **Count**: Use a frequency counter (like `collections.Counter`) to find the most common character in that column.
4.  **Assemble**: Append the most common character to the result string.

### Code Snippet

```python
num_cols = len(lines[0])
columns = ['' for _ in range(num_cols)]

for line in lines:
    for i, char in enumerate(line):
        columns[i] += char

message = ""
for col in columns:
    counts = Counter(col)
    message += counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
return message
```

## Part 2

The second part states that the repetition code was actually modified: the correct character is the *least* frequent character at each position.

### Strategy

The strategy is identical to Part 1, except for the selection criteria.

1.  **Transpose**: Same as Part 1.
2.  **Count**: Same as Part 1.
3.  **Select**: Instead of the most common, pick the *least* common character. `Counter.most_common()` returns a list sorted by frequency descending, so the last element is the least common.

### Code Snippet

```python
# ... (transpose logic same as above) ...

message = ""
for col in columns:
    counts = Counter(col)
    # Get the least common character (last in the sorted list)
    message += counts.most_common()[-1][0]
return message
```
