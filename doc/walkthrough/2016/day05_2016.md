# Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess?

## Part 1

The problem asks us to generate a password by finding MD5 hashes of a door ID followed by an increasing integer index. A hash indicates a valid password character if it starts with five zeros. The sixth character of the hash is the next character of the password.

### Strategy

1.  **Loop**: Iterate through integers `index` starting from 0.
2.  **Hash**: Calculate the MD5 hash of `door_id + str(index)`.
3.  **Check**: If the hexadecimal representation of the hash starts with `00000`:
    *   Extract the 6th character (index 5).
    *   Append it to the password.
4.  **Repeat**: Continue until the password has 8 characters.

### Code Snippet

```python
door_id = self.input_data.strip()
password = ""
index = 0
while len(password) < 8:
    test_string = f"{door_id}{index}"
    result = hashlib.md5(test_string.encode()).hexdigest()
    if result.startswith("00000"):
        password += result[5]
    index += 1
return password
```

## Part 2

The second part changes how the password is constructed. The 6th character of the hash now represents the *position* (0-7) in the password, and the 7th character is the *value* to place there. We only fill a position if it's valid and hasn't been filled yet.

### Strategy

1.  **Initialize**: Create a placeholder password (e.g., list of 8 underscores).
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through indices.
3.  **Hash**: Calculate MD5 hash.
4.  **Check**: If hash starts with `00000`:
    *   Extract the 6th character (position).
    *   Check if it's a valid digit '0'-'7'.
    *   Convert to integer `pos`.
    *   If `password[pos]` is still empty (underscore):
        *   Extract the 7th character (value).
        *   Place it in `password[pos]`.
        *   Increment the count of found characters.
5.  **Repeat**: Continue until all 8 positions are filled.

### Code Snippet

```python
password = ['_'] * 8
index = 0
found_chars = 0

while found_chars < 8:
    test_string = f"{door_id}{index}"
    result = hashlib.md5(test_string.encode()).hexdigest()
    if result.startswith("00000"):
        position_char = result[5]
        if '0' <= position_char <= '7':
            position = int(position_char)
            if password[position] == '_':
                password[position] = result[6]
                found_chars += 1
    index += 1
    
return "".join(password)
```
